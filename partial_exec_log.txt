### Purpose of Phase 4 Validation

**Why a separate validation notebook?**

Phase 3 trained and initially evaluated the models. Phase 4 performs **comprehensive validation** including:

1. **Deeper Pe

### Model Prediction Workflow

**What happens in this section:**

For each model (FNN, LSTM, Hybrid), we:
1. **Load test data**: Previously unseen samples from 2020-2023
2. **Preprocess features**: Sc
